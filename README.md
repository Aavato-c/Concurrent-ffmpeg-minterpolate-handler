# A concurrent handler using Python for ffmpeg minterpolate filter

Base on a [script](https://gist.github.com/sgqy/f551e8630d6f9d55684e60706e6d41fb) by [sgqy.](https://gist.github.com/sgqy)

A concurrent handler using Python for ffmpeg minterpolate filter. It can be used to interpolate frames in a video file using different methods. The script will combine the interpolated frames with the original frames to create a new video file. 

The results might be bad and this is something done for a particular use case: glitching videos.
